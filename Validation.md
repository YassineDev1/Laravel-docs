# Form Validation

Validation in Laravel allows you to ensure that the data entered by users meets specific rules and requirements. Laravel provides a robust and expressive validation system that helps you validate user input and handle validation errors effectively. In this README, we will cover the basics of validation in Laravel.

## Defining Validation Rules

Validation rules specify the requirements for the data being validated. In Laravel, you can define these rules using an associative array, where the keys represent the field names, and the values represent the validation rules.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Validator;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

$rules = [
    'name' => 'required|string|max:255',
    'email' => 'required|email|unique:users|max:255',
    'password' => 'required|string|min:6|confirmed',
];

$validator = Validator::make($request->all(), $rules);
```

In the example above, we define validation rules for three fields: `name`, `email`, and `password`. Each field has specific validation rules such as `required`, `string`, `max`, `email`, `unique`, and `confirmed`.

## Performing Validation

To perform validation, you can use the `Validator` facade provided by Laravel. The `make` method accepts the data to be validated and the validation rules. You can then use various methods to check if the validation passes or fails.

```php
if ($validator->fails()) {
    // Validation failed
    $errors = $validator->errors();
} else {
    // Validation passed
}
```

In the example above, if the validation fails, you can retrieve the validation errors using the `errors` method of the validator.

## Displaying Validation Errors

To display validation errors to the user, you can leverage Laravel's built-in error bag and error messages functionality. Typically, you can display the error messages near the corresponding form fields.

```html
<!-- Blade Template -->
<input type="text" name="name">
@if ($errors->has('name'))
    <span class="error">{{ $errors->first('name') }}</span>
@endif
```

In the example above, we check if there are any validation errors for the `name` field and display the first error message if it exists.

## Custom Error Messages

Laravel allows you to customize error messages for specific validation rules. You can pass an associative array to the `Validator::make` method, where the keys are the field names, and the values are arrays of validation rules and custom error messages.

```php
$messages = [
    'name.required' => 'The name field is required.',
    'email.required' => 'The email field is required.',
];

$validator = Validator::make($request->all(), $rules, $messages);
```

In the above example, we provide custom error messages for the `required` rule on the `name` and `email` fields.

## Form Request Validation

Laravel also provides a convenient way to perform validation using Form Request classes. Form requests are custom request classes that contain validation rules and authorize logic. They allow you to encapsulate the validation logic for a particular request and keep your controllers clean.

To generate a new Form Request class, you can use the `make:request` Artisan command:

```shell
php artisan make:request StoreUserRequest
```

The generated class will be placed in the `

app/Http/Requests` directory.

```php
namespace App\Http\Requests;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\FormRequest;

class StoreUserRequest extends FormRequest
{
    public function authorize()
    {
        return true;
    }

    public function rules()
    {
        return [
            'name' => 'required|string|max:255',
            'email' => 'required|email|unique:users|max:255',
            'password' => 'required|string|min:6|confirmed',
        ];
    }
}
```

In the example above, we define the authorization logic in the `authorize` method and the validation rules in the `rules` method.

To use the Form Request in a controller, you can type-hint it in the controller method:

```php
use App\Http\Requests\StoreUserRequest;

public function store(StoreUserRequest $request)
{
    // The request has already been validated
}
```

Laravel will automatically validate the incoming request using the defined validation rules in the Form Request class.

## Additional Validation Rules

Laravel provides a wide range of validation rules out of the box. Some of the commonly used validation rules include:

- `required`: The field must be present and not empty.
- `string`: The field must be a string.
- `email`: The field must be a valid email address.
- `numeric`: The field must be a numeric value.
- `date`: The field must be a valid date.
- `confirmed`: The field value must be confirmed by another field (usually used for password confirmation).
- `unique:table,column,except,idColumn`: The field value must be unique in a given table column (except for a specific ID column).

You can refer to the Laravel documentation for a complete list of available validation rules and their usage.
