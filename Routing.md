# Routing

Routing in Laravel allows you to define how your application responds to different URLs. It maps URLs to specific actions or controllers that handle the requests. In this README, we will cover the basics of routing in Laravel.

## Defining Routes

In Laravel, routes are defined in the `routes/web.php` or `routes/api.php` files, depending on your application's needs. You can define routes using various HTTP verbs such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, etc.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/welcome', function () {
    return 'Welcome to Laravel!';
});

Route::post('/user', function () {
    return 'User created!';
});
```

In the example above, we have defined two routes: a `GET` route that responds to `/welcome` URL with a simple message, and a `POST` route that responds to `/user` URL with a message indicating the successful creation of a user.

## Route Parameters

Often, you need to capture dynamic segments from the URL as route parameters. You can define route parameters by enclosing them in curly braces `{}`.

```php
Route::get('/user/{id}', function ($id) {
    return "User ID: " . $id;
});
```

In the above example, the `id` segment in the URL will be captured as a route parameter. It can be accessed within the route's closure or controller method.

## Named Routes

Named routes allow you to give a specific name to a route, making it easier to reference in your application. You can assign a name to a route using the `name` method.

```php
Route::get('/profile', function () {
    // ...
})->name('profile');
```

With the named route defined, you can generate the URL for that route using the `route` helper function.

```php
$url = route('profile');
```

## Route Groups

Route groups allow you to group related routes together and apply common attributes or middleware to them. This helps to organize your routes and avoid repetition.

```php
Route::prefix('admin')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', function () {
        // ...
    });
    Route::get('/users', function () {
        // ...
    });
});
```

In the example above, both `/admin/dashboard` and `/admin/users` routes are grouped under the `/admin` prefix. This means that the URLs for these routes will start with `/admin`.

## Route Prefixes

Route prefixes allow you to add a common prefix to a group of routes without creating a separate route group. It helps to define a common URL segment for related routes.

```php
Route::prefix('api')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/users', function () {
        // ...
    });
    Route::post('/products', function () {
        // ...
    });
});
```

In the above example, both `/api/users` and `/api/products` routes share the `/api` prefix.

## Route Middleware

Middleware provides a convenient way to filter HTTP requests entering your application. You can assign middleware to routes or groups of routes to perform tasks such as authentication, authorization, request preprocessing, etc.

```php
Route::middleware('auth')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', function () {
        // ...
    });
    Route::get('/profile', function () {
       

 // ...
    });
});
```

In the example above, both `/dashboard` and `/profile` routes are assigned the `auth` middleware, which ensures that the user must be authenticated to access these routes.
